You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":5,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"mdzolo6faxpdrer2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","6tjtoi7k9e81na97":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{"added":{"0ok83z5o0sxd8ft8":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"amLN9DXpyVdVJc3y":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"mdzolo6faxpdrer2","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","advancementOrigin":"7j4cb5joriivaqjb.9ojqd2dejdsffabi"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"ownership":{"default":0,"amLN9DXpyVdVJc3y":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"LtV76VTswyRQgTSv","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-jeweled-purple.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":2000000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.0E565kQUBmndJ1a2"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

dios de las almas ᛊᛃᛚᛞᚢᚱ \"Syldir</h4>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Orígenes</strong></h2>\n<p>Año 1045. Hijo de un AASIMAR y una mujer de la remota aldea llamada ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ \"Betis\", Sköl se crió sin saber la importancia de su linaje como AASIMAR. Su familia nunca se lo dijo ya que esto sólo les pondría en peligro y expondría la identidad de un AASIMAR , algo que es delito en su sociedad. Tenía un hermano llamado ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ \"Viriato\" y tuvo una juventud poco destacable, pero buena bajo el Punto de Vista de un Churkin. No merece la pena describirla. Lo que quizás merece la pena describir es que nació en el santuario y convento de Betis donde también fue bendecido por un chaman llamado ᛒᛟᚲᚱᚨ \"Vokra\".</p>\n<h2>La vida en ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ</h2>\n<p>Con 14 años en 1059 su vida empieza a cambiar. Vivía en una familia pobre y esto le obligó a empezar a buscar dinero pronto para su mucho más joven hermano. Debido a esta necesidad se vio obligado a integrarse en la sociedad Churkin de ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ \"Betis\". Esta sociedad es muy dura ya que el clima y la geografía dificultan mucho cualquier trabajo,  pero por suerte las duras condiciones también tienen ventajas. La gente en ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ es de la más amable y compasiva que uno puede encontrar en el continente debido a la necesidad  de permanecer juntos durante el invierno para sobrevivir. Entre sí la gente del poblado se tratan como hermanos, fuera de ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ.......bueno digamos que \"no tanto\".</p>\n<p>La comida del lugar también es excelente y se transmite entre generaciones mediante manuscritos hechos de piel de \"Animal que viva allí\" y como detalle ᛊᚲᛟᛚ \"Sköl\" tiene 3. Uno de su familia, otro robado por su hermano ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ y uno que adquirió tras la muerte de un viejo amigo de la familia por causa de un lobo salvaje, ᛊᚲᛟᛚ es un chef increíble.</p>\n<p>Sköl también era extremadamente religioso como gran parte de el poblado, a veces ante estas condiciones de vida no queda otra que ser religioso y rezar para que todo salga bien.</p>\n<h2>Guerreros del Valthreim</h2>\n<p>Con 25 años en 1070, ᛊᚲᛟᛚ desarrolló un interés por la caza, pero no poseía las habilidades necesarias para manejar en arco o arma de caza. Por eso ᛊᚲᛟᛚ tenía un rol distinto en el grupo de caza del monte Valthreim al que se unió. Su trabajo para la caza de bestias más grandes era de cebo. Se ponía una armadura pesada y atraía a la bestia, si todo salía bien la. Bestia no llega a a hacerle nada, si no, le tocaba luchar con ella y esperar al plan B. Allí se volvió un auténtico maestro de la armadura pesada y de la lucha contra bestias. Tanto es así que se ganó el apodo de ᛊᚲᛟᛚ  ᛈᛁᛚᚨᚱ ᛞᛖᛚ ᛗᛟᚾᛏᛖ ᛒᚨᛚᛏᚱᛁᛗ \"Sköl, pilar del monte Valthreim\" tan difícil de derribar como la propia montaña XD. Además le encantaba su trabajo, el estar en el corazón de la batalla le hacía sentirse vivo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>La tragedia del ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ</h2>\n<p>Año 1073, el invierno llega y mientras ᛊᚲᛟᛚ, ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ y el grupo de caza se encontraban en la montaña de Valthreim bajo una tormenta de nieve ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ es atacado.</p>\n<p>Un grupo de guerreros destruyen y borran del mapa ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ. Sin piedad alguna no dejan una piedra sobre otra y la gente es masacrada. Desde arriba no se veía nada hasta que ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ con un ojo de halcón divisa una columna de humo negro en el pueblo. El grupo baja lo más rápido posible de la montaña, pero al bajar ya no hay nada más que piedras y ceniza. El grupo de caza y los 2 hermanos se separan y deciden investigar, ᛊᚲᛟᛚ nunca volvió a ver al grupo.</p>\n<p>Los 2 hermanos siguen el camino hacia el pueblo contiguo y encuentran un carruaje lleno de recursos y dañado frente al convento de ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ. Obviamente reconocen que estas son sus cosas, son parte de las pertenencias del poblado. El carro no puede avanzar y ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ los quiere matar, pero ᛊᚲᛟᛚ se lo impide para protegerle, es su hermano mayor, le saca 1 cm de altura, y es su deber protegerlo. Así que idean un plan, eran 6 personas y hacían turnos de 2 en 2 para arreglar el carro. De vez en cuando se reunían parra hablar de la situación. La idea era fabricar rápido una mezcla venenosa con los materiales que disponen y aprovechar las pausas colectivas para encerrarles en el carro con la toxina. El plan funciona y 4 de Los 6 afortunados mueren, los otros 2...mejor que lo cuente ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ, lo que les hizo era fuerte hasta para un Churkin.</p>\n<h2>La supuesta traición y la Fé en ᛊᛃᛚᛞᚢᚱ</h2>\n<p>Después de eso ᛊᚲᛟᛚ se metió en el convento y se encontró de que los chamanes seguían escondidos en el templo. Sabiendo que no tenían a dónde ir pidió que le acogieron y estos lo hicieron. Allí aprendió durante 10 años hasta el 1083 las artes de los chamanes y sobre sus poderes. Alguno le llamó la atención, pero ᛊᛃᛚᛞᚢᚱ\"syldir\" fue el dios elegido por ᛊᚲᛟᛚ. La idea de sacar fuerza de el alma y guiar las almas perdidas de Humanos y animales le gustó al estar muy en contacto con la naturaleza en la que se crió.Pero durante su aprendizaje hubo una Cosa en la que no podía parar de pensar. Si tan poderosos son los dioses y esta gente, porque se habían escondido durante el ataque en vez de luchar. Tanto fue el enfado acumulado tras los años cuanto mas aprendía de sus poderes, que por esto un día dejó su hogar en el convento y se fue.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Fenrìsúlfur </h2>\n<p>Ahora te preguntaras de donde viene el segundo nombre, no es su apellido, se deshizo de ellos tras la masacre porque le traían malos recuerdos.</p>\n<p>En el momento en el que ᛊᚲᛟᛚ se fue del convento, \"Vokra\" que estuvo en el convento desde el nacimiento de ᛊᚲᛟᛚ salió a convencerle de que no lo hiciese y le acompañó a la montaña a darle una charla. </p>\n<p>Durante esa charla un lobo gigante de la zona, una especie llamada Fenrir atacó a los dos, pero fracasó y lo mataron con la magia del chamán. Normalmente los chamanes de Syldir no son capaces de absorver y guías a las almas de las bestias ya que son fieras y indomables, pero ᛊᚲᛟᛚ si que pudo. El chamán se quedó alucinando y le pidió que viniese una última vez al convento. Allí le enseño una profecía, la profecía del domador de bestias, uno de los chamanes destinados a liderar Churkin a la gloria. Como el animal al que mató fue un Fenrir el chaman le dio el apodo de Fenrirsúlfùr o domador del Fenrir. Después le dio el libro de la profecìa y le permitió irse con la condición de que algún día  volviese a enseñar lo que aprenda en un futuro sobre su dios ᛊᛃᛚᛞᚢᚱ\"Syldir\". ᛊᚲᛟᛚ subió a la montaña  y uso las garras y colmillos del Fenrir como adorno en su armadura, para hacerse un collar y recordar lo que en realidad siempre sería su hogar. ᛒᛖᛏᛁᛊ.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ᛊᚲᛟᛚ se marcha y sigue el camino marcado por el libro, llevándole a cazar bestias para aprender más sobre su dios y la profecía.</p>\n<p>ᛒᛁᚱᛁᚨᛏᛟ le sigue y los 2 se encuentran con un grupo de extranjeros peculiares.... quien sabrá que es lo que pasará después. El mago huele fatal, demasiado tiempo sentado haciendo excels y tryhardeando.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>El convento todavía retiene la habitación de ᛊᚲᛟᛚ y Vokra le sigue siendo fiel, por lo cual le deja usar su habitación en el convento como almacén, a parte de recibirlo si algún día vuelve por allí.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","public":""},"alignment":"LAwfull, neutral","race":"AASIMAR","background":"","originalClass":"eanrgq7vstg9xgrz","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300},"appearance":"","trait":"","ideal":"","bond":"","flaw":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["necrotic","radiant"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":""},"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl"],"custom":""},"toolProf":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":1,"sp":4,"cp":6},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":2,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":3,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":3,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":2,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"primary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"secondary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"tertiary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"EkBjaHUIGZ1pQeoq":3,"sW2bevCkThu6Y1xg":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"ᛊᚲöᛚ ᚠᛖᚾᚱᛁᚱᛊùᛚᚠᚢᚱ","displayName":50,"actorLink":true,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"disposition":1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"#000000","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"core":{"priority":null},"healthEstimate":{"dontMarkDead":false,"hideHealthEstimate":false,"hideName":false},"monks-little-details":{"token-combat-animation":"","token-highlight":""}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"https://i.ibb.co/ZMYpmP0/Nico-CAmpania-medieval-comic-2.jpg","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":160,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

This small size allows them to crawl into narrow passages and through tiny holes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rubbery Skinned: The Dogs skin is rubbery and squishy, allowing them to ignore 2 points of damage from any source.  A Dog can increase their damage reduction to +4 through the use of their Stretchy Powers (see below).  Also a Dog is able to rearrange their internal organs at will, making them immune to Critical Hits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stretchy Powers: The Stretchy Powers mechanic allows the Dog to transform their body in special and unique ways.  The This could be transforming their hands into claws, a scythe, stretching their body to attempt to constrict and hold an opponent (this would still require an attack roll), grow wings to fly, or whatever creative ideas the player can come up with.  A Dog can grow and shrink in size as well.  A Dog can grow to Large, Huge, and Gargantuan.  Each one increases the damage done with their weapons by one step on the Die Ladder, decreases their AC by 1.  A Dog can also shrink to Small, Tiny, and Diminutive as well.  Each one decreases the damage done with their weapons by one step on the Die Ladder and increases their AC by +1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To use a Stretchy Power, the player describes the desired effect and rolls their Stretchy Die.  If the result is a 3 or higher, it is a success.  The Dog can only have two Stretchy Powers going at the same time (I.E. transforming eyes into Compound Eyes and grow wings out of back to fly).  Many of the creative solutions the player creates may have a mechanical impact, it should be deliberated with the GM on exactly how this functions.  In the end, the GM has final decision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Language: Common and Animal.</p>\n<table

elásticos mechanic allows Barry to transform their body in special and unique ways.  This could be transforming their hands into claws, a scythe, stretching their body to attempt to constrict and hold an opponent (this would still require an attack roll), grow wings to fly, or whatever creative ideas the player can come up with.  A Dog can grow and shrink in size as well.  A Dog can grow to Medium,
